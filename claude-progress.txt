Session 1 - Initialization (2026-01-28)
Task: Implement failed approaches tracking in orchestration loop

## Problem Analysis

The infrastructure for tracking failed approaches exists but is never used:
- RecoveryStore has record_attempt() method but it's never called
- loop.py retrieves failed_approaches but they're always empty
- review.py and qa.py hardcode failed_approaches_section=''
- Prompts have {failed_approaches_section} placeholder that's never populated

This means agents have no memory of what approaches failed previously, leading to:
- Repeating the same failed approaches
- No learning from previous mistakes
- Inefficient iteration loops

## Solution Design

Based on Auto-Claude's implementation pattern:

1. **RecoveryStore Enhancement**
   - Add get_recovery_hints() method to format attempt history
   - Show last 3 attempts with approach + success/fail status
   - Add warning: "Try a DIFFERENT approach" for failed attempts
   - Format with ⚠️ warnings for visibility

2. **Loop.py Integration**
   - Call record_attempt() after each session in _run_session()
   - Extract approach from subtask.description (simple string)
   - Mark success based on session_result.status == SessionStatus.COMPLETE
   - Include error message from events if session failed

3. **Review/QA Loop Integration**
   - Remove hardcoded empty strings for failed_approaches_section
   - Pass recovery_store to fix functions
   - Call get_recovery_hints() to get formatted hints
   - Inject hints into coder prompt during fix iterations

4. **Prompt Template Updates**
   - Update coder.md to format hints section with warnings
   - Show previous attempts clearly with success/fail indicators
   - Use ⚠️ emoji for visibility when hints are present

## Implementation Plan

Created 12 subtasks:
1. Add get_recovery_hints() method to RecoveryStore
2. Update loop.py to call record_attempt() after sessions
3. Fix review.py to use recovery hints
4. Fix qa.py to use recovery hints
5. Update coder.md prompt template
6. Unit tests for RecoveryStore.get_recovery_hints()
7. Unit tests for loop.py record_attempt() calls
8. Integration test for full workflow
9. Update function signatures to pass recovery_store
10. Run full test suite with coverage check
11. Run quality checks (ruff, mypy)
12. Update this progress file with final summary

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Approach Extraction**: Use subtask.description directly as approach
   - Simple and straightforward
   - Already contains the approach being attempted
   - No need for complex parsing

2. **Success Criteria**: SessionStatus.COMPLETE determines success
   - Clear boolean signal
   - Aligns with existing loop logic
   - No ambiguity

3. **Hint Format**: Follow Auto-Claude pattern
   - Proven to work in production
   - Clear visual warnings with emojis
   - Limited to last 3 attempts to avoid prompt bloat

4. **Integration Points**:
   - loop.py: Main coder sessions
   - review.py: Review fix iterations
   - qa.py: QA fix iterations
   - All three need recovery context

## Next Session

Start with subtask-1: Implement get_recovery_hints() method in RecoveryStore.
This is the foundation that other subtasks will build upon.
